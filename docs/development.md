# Development

## Getting Started

A hosted version of Teation can be found at [teation.com](https://teation.com).

Documentation is still a work in progress. A bit of refactoring is still required before writing getting started instructions for development.

For now, check out the [architecture](./architecture.md) documentation for a better understanding of the platform.

You can also check out the `/apps/*/README.md` files for more information about that particular app.

## Contributions

PRs are welcomed, however please submit a GitHub issue before working on a PR. This is a hobby project, therefore I may not be available to merge PRs while I'm working on other projects. I would also want to make sure that the changes are in line with the current roadmap.
